                <p>I am a Computer Science student with hands-on experience in front-end development, proficient in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and modern frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js. I’ve developed various projects, including a personal portfolio website and an e-commerce application, showcasing my ability to create responsive and engaging web interfaces. With experience as a Front-End Development Intern and freelance web developer, I bring strong problem-solving skills and a keen eye for design, supported by certifications in front-end development and JavaScript. I am eager to apply my skills in a dynamic internship or entry-level role to further contribute to innovative projects.</p>
                <p>I’ve always dreamed of being an engineer, and even though I’ve changed my focus, my background in science has greatly influenced how I view things. I still see design as a science, just like physics or computing. So, I enjoy design, especially when I can dive deep into the details and apply my nerdy side to it.</p>
